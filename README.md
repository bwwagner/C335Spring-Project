# ASMroids
Spring 2016 C335 Project

Developer: Branden Wagner

A 2 dimensional game called ASMroids!  In this game, you’re actually controlling a computer program, represented by a cyber-space ship, through an asteroid field which represents errors in the program!  

The background will be black like the depths of cyberspace.  The space ship, bullets, and asteroids are printed to console using ASCII strings.

The ship will be controllable, and the player can fire bullets at the asteroids.  When an asteroid is encountered, you will navigate the ship to either avoid them, or you will use your laser blasters to destroy them.  If you collide with an asteroid you will be destroyed and a program syntax error message will appear on the screen for the player representing program failure and the end of the game. 

You will have 3 lives before the end of game is reached. The score will be kept and displayed along with an error message from the ship crash.

This project includes some code from the Irvine ASM libraries (http://asmirvine.com/) used for educational purposes only.
