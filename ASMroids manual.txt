ASMroids is an action game where you control a program debugger to destroy errors in your  
program. The errors appear as large asteroids which must be destroyed.  Be careful!   
Destroying a large asteroid causes it to split into smaller asteroids which are harder  
to track, and will split once more to smallest syntax asteroids before being removed.  
You will be faced with many asteroids which will seem to increase in number constantly  
(unless you are godlike).  
Although final victory over errors may not be possible,  
try to get the highest debugging score that you can!  
Good Luck!
